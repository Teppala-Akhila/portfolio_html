    <h2>REAL-TIME FACE RECOGNITION FOR CCTV SURVEILLANCE</h2>
    <p>
        I led the development of a Python-based web application that provides secure user authentication and real-time face recognition. 
        The system includes registration and login functionality with credentials stored in SQLite using password hashing for enhanced security.
        Tools were implemented to manage user profiles and face data while enabling recognition from images, uploaded videos, and live camera streams. 
        Flask-SocketIO was integrated to support smooth real-time communication, and Pandas was used for handling and maintaining structured user metadata. 
        This project effectively combines web development, database management, and computer vision technologies to deliver a robust, secure, and efficient recognition system.
        
        Technologies Used: Python, Flask, Flask-SocketIO, SQLite, OpenCV, face_recognition
